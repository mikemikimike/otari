"""mcp's pyproject.toml constraint must keep mcp 2.0+ out of a fresh
resolution, not just satisfy the committed uv.lock.

uv.lock pins mcp 1.28.1, so `uv sync` here never re-resolves and never
notices a missing (or misplaced) ceiling: CI stays green even though a
fresh, unlocked resolution elsewhere (a fresh clone before the first `uv
lock`, a consuming superset build resolving otari's tree alongside its own)
can pick up mcp 2.0, which removed
`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client`.
`gateway/services/mcp_client.py` imports that at module scope, so every
gateway command dies with ImportError the moment that happens. See #689.

This resolves mcp into a throwaway venv using only the constraint declared
in pyproject.toml - uv.lock is never consulted - and proves the actual
import that broke still works against whatever version that constraint
allows today. If the ceiling is ever loosened, dropped, or simply placed
too high (e.g. "<3.0.0"), this installs the newest matching mcp and fails
the same way production did; the static shape check in
tests/unit/test_mcp_dependency_ceiling.py only catches a ceiling missing
entirely.

Real network I/O and subprocess/venv creation, not a pure-function check -
hence tests/integration rather than tests/unit.
